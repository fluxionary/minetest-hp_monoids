# [WIP] hp_monoids

defines two monoids, one which manages maximum HP, and one which manages rate of healing.

*DO NOT* use this mod, i think i'm going to replace the healing monoid w/ a status effect, and the hp max monoid
w/ a player attribute.

when maximum HP is variable, it is much more clear when using
[hudbars](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/hudbars/) instead of the built-in "heart" statbars.
